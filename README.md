play OUTSIDE!
=============
*(pun intended)*

***Outside*** is an Android arcade game app inspired from [Conways's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), with the goal of not only to entertain, but also to train certain cognitive abilities, such as short term and spacial recall memory skills, reaction abilities, as well as fine motor skills to a certain degree. 

Outside was awarded winner of TechU.me's AppJam 2016, in the Independent Stream. The project took a total of approximately 80 hours to complete.

Gist of the Game
----------------
On the screen, arbitrary white dots will appear. For each round, the main goal of the game is to locate, then tap at the centre of a 5 by 5 area with the greatest number of white dots. The catch? It's timed, there are no gridlines, and 3 mess-ups and you're out. 

**2 Modes** 
* Speed mode: increasingly shorter time limits. 
* Memory mode: after a certain time, the screen blacks out. The centre of the most crowded 5 by 5 area must then be located without being able to see where they were previously located.

Installation
